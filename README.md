# CS-370 Current/Emerging Trends in Computer Science

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  This project was designed to create an agent (a pirate) that would use a deep Q learning algorithm to learn to navigate a maze to the reward (a treasure). I was given the parts of the program that set up the maze conditions and the possible moves that the agent could make. I created the deep Q learning algorithm that trained the agent to learn to navigate the maze.
  
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
    Computer Scientist design, construct, and assess the hardware and software used to solve problems in a wide range of contexts, such as for business, industrial, educational, and social use. In a world where         digitization is becoming more and more common, information security allows for fraud detection and gives people a sense of security, but bad actors still pose a threat. On the other hand, HCI empowers people       who are frequently disregarded in society, such as the disabled. Data science allows us to use the data that we collect to predict and avoid catastrophes as well as advance the medical capabilities of our          healthcare systems.
  How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
    There are four primary steps in problem solving: Identify the problem. The first step in problem solving is identifying the correct problem to solve. Next, Create a solution. Develop an algorithm to solve the       problem. Third, put the solution into practice. Write the code to solve the problem. Finally, verify the solution. Make sure that your solution solves the problem, in an ethical manner.    
  What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
    As a computer scientist, I should avoid conflicts of interest; respect all forms of employer-owned intellectual property; use due diligence when developing software; and be as open and honest as possible about     known and unknown flaws in the program. However, the most crucial duty is to protect the public's health, safety, and welfare.
